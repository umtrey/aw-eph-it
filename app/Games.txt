      are wild.The dealer deals out all the cards.  Multiple decks may be necessary.
      \ The person left of the dealer goes first, and lays down any card or set of
      cards of the same value.  (Eg. three 4's or a single 3 perhaps.)  The person
      to their left must lay down cards of greater value, and the same number of cards.
      \ (Eg. If three 8's were laid down, three 9's or greater must be laid down.
      \ Four 9's would not be allowed, it has to be 3.)  If they cannot lay down any
      cards, they pass to the next person.  (You may also choose to pass.)Anyone
      who passes must drink.The circle continues until no one can play any
      more cards.  The last person to lay down cards has \"control\" and starts the
      next round by laying down new cards.  Play continues until everyone is out of
      cards.After the first round has been played, the first person out
      is the President.  The second person out is the Vice-President, and the last
      two people out are the Vice-Asshole and Asshole for the second-last and last
      person respectively.Once ranks are established and after all the
      cards have been redealt, the Asshole must give the President his 2 best cards,
      and the President gives the Asshole his 2 worst cards.  The Vice-President and
      Vice-Asshole also switch worst and best cards, but only 1 each.  Play begins
      again with the person left of the dealer.At the end of each round,
      the Asshole must clear the cards and gather them into a pile.  If anyone else
      touches the pile of cards during play, they automatically switch ranks with
      the Asshole.  If the same person remains Asshole for 3 whole rounds, they become
      subject to the whims of other players and must drink when told.2's
      are wild, and will beat any card played, including an Ace.  Once a two is played
      the cards are cleared and the person playing the 2 has control.  One 2 also
      beats a pair of anything, two 2's will beat three of anything, three 2's beats
      4 of anything, etc..."

    fulldescription: ! "Players: 1Beer Pong is a drinking
      game in which players throw a ping-pong ball across a table with the intent
      of landing the ball in a cup of beer on the other end. The game typically consists
      of two 2-player teams and multiple cups set up on each side set up in triangle
      formation, much like bowling pins or billiard balls in their starting positions.
      The goal of the game is to eliminate the other teams' cups before one's
      own cups are eliminated. When a ball lands in a cup, that cup is eliminated
      and the defending team must consume all of the beer inside that cup.The
      losing team must consume all the beer remaining in the winning team's cups.
      Throwing the ball can be done with an arc shot, or straight line, or
      a bounce shot.This is not a game for the casual player.  It is a serious
      competition, one involving skill, luck, and of course a little booze.  There
      are leagues dedicated to the fineries of this endeavour.  There are varying
      rulesets depending on where you play, but one official ruleset is well defined

      game.  Choose one person who is the \"Rider\" and the other will be the \"Bus
      Driver\".  The bus driver shuffles a deck of cards and deals 5 cards out face
      down on the table.  He then asks the rider whether the last card dealt is black
      or red.  If the rider guesses wrong he takes one sip of his drink (which should
      be pretty strong).  The card he guessed at is then discarded and the \"Bus Driver\"
      deals another 5 cards face down on top of the 4 that remain.  If the rider was
      to guess correctly, the bus driver would then ask him whether or not the next
      card in the line will be higher or lower than the one that was just flipped
      (aces are low).  If he guesses correctly the driver continues flipping cards
      and asking the higher or lower question until the rider either gets to the front
      of the bus (all the cards are gone) or guesses wrong.  If he does guess wrong
      then he has to sip once for that card and once for every card that he guessed
      right previously in the string.  The goal then is to get to the front of the
      bus in one string.  This gets continually harder for every card that is dealt
      out.  Once every card is dealt out you jsut go down the line until you get to
      the front of the bus. The game is almost impossible to beat on a single string
      and 90% of the time you end up taking 52 sips.  Whether or not the driver deals
      out all of the cards, when the person gets to the front of the bus every person
      in the room has to finish their drinks within 2 minutes.It helps
      to have a drink or two before you start playing because it makes the impossiblty
      of the game much easier to swallow.  You can also play Ride the Plane which
      is the same except you deal 10 cards out for every wrong guess.This

      players stand on opposite sides of a table, facing one another. In front of
      each teammate is a plastic cup filled with a set amount of beer. At
      the start, the first member of each team drinks their beverage.The empty
      cup is placed face up at the edge of the table, and the player who drank it
      attempts to flip the cup, by flicking or lifting the bottom until it flips and
      lands face down on the table, sitting on its mouth. If player is unsuccessful,
      the cup is reset and re-flipped. Only after the first teammate is done
      flipping successfully can the next person proceed. Whichever team finishes drinking
      and flipping all its cups first wins.When flipping, a player cannot
      use two hands or \"guide\" the cup into the downward position. It must be a
      quick, one-touch motion."

      If you guess right, pass the coin to your right. If you guess wrong, pass the
      coin to your left and either take one article of clothing off (anything that
      is a pair counts as one item) or take a drink.If you guess right,
      you can choose to flip again.  Another successful guess lets you pass the coin
      to anyone of your choosing.  A wrong guess has normal consequences.If
      you guess right three times in a row, you may retrieve an article of clothing
      and put it back on.  The coin is then passed to your right.Lousy

      to get on the floor as soon as possible (if you don’t have enough room, just
      put your hand on the floor). As soon as someone else notices, they do the same.
      The last person to realise what’s going on has to drink.5 Waterfall - Fill
      your drinks up, then everyone in the circle starts drinking at the same time.
      The person who picked the card can continue drinking for as long as they want,
      but the second person cannot stop drinking until they have, the third person
      cannot stop until the second has and so on.6 Chicks - Girls drink7 dicks
      - Guys drink (no it doesn’t rhyme like the other one).8 for a mate - Nominate
      someone to drink with you.9 Bust a rhyme - Whoever picks the card must say
      a phrase. The next person then says a phrase that rhymes and so on until someone
      screws up. They then have to drink.10 Chinny - If someone turns over a 10,
      everyone else must scramble to the nearest wall and place their chin on it.
      The person who turns over then card then judges who was last and that person
      has to drink.Jack Thumb Master - An oldy but a goody: The person who turns
      over a Jack becomes Thumb Master until someone turns another Jack over from
      the ring. At any point during the drinking game, the Thumb Master can put his
      thumb on the table or his/her forehead. Everyone else must follow, and the last
      person to realise has to drink.Dancing Queen - This works in the same way
      that Thumb Master does, except the Dancing Queen, er, dances. Once the Dancing
      Queen starts up his/her favourite moves, everyone must follow and the last person
      to do so drinks.King's cup - The first three people to pick up a King add
      some of their drink (whatever it is) to the cup in the middle - the fourth person
      drinks it.Ace off your face - Down it!"

    fulldescription: ! "First, the players divide into teams of 2. Partners sit across
      the table from each other. The cards are all dealt out. The point of the game
      is to score the most points. You score a point every time you lay the card of
      the same value as the person before you laid. To make things more interesting,
      there are \"safe cards\": Eights and Jacks. You cannot lay a safe card on another
      safe card (i.e. no 8 on 8, J on J, 8 on J, J on 8).The team that was
      scored upon drinks until told to stop by a member of the scoring team (this
      explains the variation in the buzz factor). After each point, the cards are
      cleared by the scoring team (be sure to keep track of each point for scoring
      purposes). After all the cards have been laid, that's the end of a period.As
      in the actual game of hockey, there are 3 periods. The person to the left of

    fulldescription: ! "ho Shit is very similar to Thumper. But where Thumper was
      a game of hand gestures to identify a person, Who Shit has a type of \"Shit\"
      to identify a person. Supplies: beer and people.Prior to the beginning
      the game, everybody playing decides what type of \"Shit\" they are going to
      be. No, not actual feces, but...well, here are some examples: He Shit, Book
      Shit, Car Shit, Dumb Shit, Coffee Shit, etc. Basically anything can qualify
      as a type of Shit, including proper names, adjectives, and so on.One
      person starts the game by saying, \"Who Shit, Shit.\" Then the person who was
      called responds by saying their own Shit followed by another player's shit.
      Example:  You have four people playing:      Dumb Shit, Captain
      Shit, Sexy Shit,     and Mystery Shit. Dumb Shit begins:        DS:
      \"Who Shit, Mystery Shit\"        MS: \"Mystery Shit, Sexy Shit\"        SS:
      \"Sexy Shit, Mystery Shit\"        MS: \"Mystery Shit, Captain Shit\"
      \       etc.This continues until either somebody fails to immediately respond
      when called, or somebody calls on a non-existent shit. The person who screwed
      up then takes a drink and starts with \"Who Shit.\""

    shortdescription: ''
    fulldescription: ! "A most excellent good time dice game. Supplies needed are
      the standars people and beer, plus dice. Check the variation below for additional
      optional supplies.Everyone sits in a circle. The first order of business
      is to determine the Three Man. This is done by each player rolling a die in
      turn. The first to roll a three becomes the Three Man (see below for variation
      with the Beer Helmut.)The player to the left of the Three Man goes first,
      and play continues in a clockwise direction. The player then rolls both dice
      and acts according to the following combinations:1:1 Doubles - see below1:2
      Three man drinks (sum to 3)1:3 Three man drinks (three on die)1:4
      Thumb to table or floor (playing surface)1:5 Index finger to side of nose.1:6

      roller drinks (7 left/11 right)2:6 Pass turn3:3 Doubles - see below;

      Social4:6 Pass turn5:5 Doubles - see below5:6 Player to right
      of roller drinks (7 left/11 right)6:6 Doubles - see belowHowever,
      if on the Three Man's turn, s/he rolls a three or combination thereof, s/he
      is no longer the Three Man and then can designate any other player as the new
      Three Man. (This also includes if the Three Man rolls during a doubles give;
      see below)Social: Everybody drinksDoubles: The roller has the
      option of giving both dice to one player or one dice to two players. Whatever
      the case, the dice are rolled and the number on the dice is what that person(s)
      have to drink. (ie. roller gives the dice to Y and Z. Y rolls a 3 and Z rolls
      a five, Y drinks 3, Z drinks 5. Or Y gets both both dice and rolls a 3:5, Y
      then drinks 8.) However, if the given dice roll to doubles, the original roller
      has to drink that amount. But the original roller also keeps the turn.To
      condense everything:Total of 7 player to right of roller drinksTotal
      of 11 player to left of roller drinksTotal of 9 SocialAny 3 or sum
      to 3 Three man drinks1 and 4 thumb on floor1 and 5 finger on noseDoubles
      give 'em awayVariation with the Beer Helmut:To make the visual effect
      of the game more interesting, the Three Man should have to were some some of
      strange hat, the Beer Helmut. The Helmut could be almost anything that can be
      worn on the head, orange hunters' hat, lampshade, undergarments, etc. But tradition
      holds that the Helmut be made from a discarded case of beer, cut so the the
      handle serves as eyepieces and a nose bridge. Other ornamentation may be freely
      added, such as a plume from other cardboard or feathers. It should look like
      something worn into battle. Thus the name, Beer Helmut.When the Three
      Man no longer is the Three Man due to skillful rolling, part of the ceremony
      is the passing of the Helmut onto the new Three Man."

    fulldescription: ! "A fantastic game. Undoubtedly when you first explain this
      game, people give blank stares and are confused, but after a quick round, everyone
      usually gets the hang of things. You'll need a deck of cards with all 8s, 9s
      and the red 10 tens removed, people, and the ever-important beer. The buzz factor
      starts out low, but with lots of people, dealing last can be dangerous at best.The
      ranks of the cards are:Face cards.5 pointsAces1.0 point2-7face
      value10swildThe game is played just like BlackJack but to 7.5 points.First,
      lay out all cards face down, everyone \"cuts for deal\". Highest card deals
      first (10 would be 7.5, 7 is very good). Deal will go from highest draw to lowest.
      Very important: you cannot leave the game until after you have dealt. That's
      why dealing first is great, dealing last has been known to result in \"Brain
      Damage.\"Dealer takes deck, deals one card face down to first player,
      one card face down to self. Player looks at card, then bets any amount of beer,
      a large shot glass is usually a good limit.Player keeps first card face
      down, and can take as many hits as he wants. If he goes over 7.5, he must announce
      that fact, and then drink the bet. If not, when he stops, dealer turns over
      his card, and then hits until he thinks he has the player beat. If dealer busts,
      he drinks the bet.When the dealer is satisfied with his hand, the player
      turns over his card. Lower total drinks. Ties mean player drinks. The dealer
      then goes to the next player, repeating the process until the deck is exhausted.If
      the player gets a \"five card charlie\" (5 cards, not busted), he wins immediately,
      dealer cannot draw, dealer loses even with a 10 in hand. If player draws to
      7.5, dealer can of course try to tie (win).If the dealer begins dealing
      begins with six or less cards, the penalty is to deal again. WIth six or less
      cards, dealer lays them face down, the player bets, they both draw a card, loser
      drinks (tie == player drinks) Play continues until everyone has dealt."

      well, as many people as you like. This is definitely one of the most infuriating

      WITH M’ in no time.1) Person A: Name ANY famous person in the whole
      world. Note: For the purposes of this drinking game only real people are allowed
      - no fictional characters.2) Person B: You must name someone whose first
      name begins with the same letter as the previous person’s surname. For example,
      if person A has said Johnny Depp, you have to name someone whose name starts
      with a ‘D’, such as David Beckham. Person A then has to name someone whose name
      begins with a ‘B’, and so on.3) The rule is ‘drink while you think’,
      so the more time you take to come up with an answer, the more you drink.If
      you play this with more than two people, go around in a circle. As an additional
      rule you can change direction whenever anyone names someone whose first name
